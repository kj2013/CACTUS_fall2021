    "Some articles contain multiple phrases. For example an article may contain \"deaf-mute\" as well as \"hearing-impaired.\" They currently show up as two separate rows, with duplicate values for everything except the deaf-mute and hearing-impaired columns. One row shows True in the deaf-mute column, and the other row shows True in the hearing-impaired column. We want to merge these two rows into one row where both columns show True."
