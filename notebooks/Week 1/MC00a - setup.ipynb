    "[Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) is an open-source platform for media analysis. It is a collaborative academic project supported by various non-profit foundations since 2011. You can use our various online tools to investigate news coverage about your topic of interest, and all the same information is available via a rich API.\n",

    "This set of notebooks is a brief introduction to the API. It covers many of the most common operations we see researchers performing. The API is fully featured, so much so that [all our web-based tools](https://tools.mediacloud.org/#/home) are built on top of it.\n",
